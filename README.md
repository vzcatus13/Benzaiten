### Paginated-Infinite-Scroll-Lazy-List Feature's branch


[Live Preview of Feature](https://619a6f99f0ab4da20c3251b6--benzaiten-vzcatus13.netlify.app/)

I can't make Apollo's client cache to work with AniList API. Therefore, data is merged in component. Because of merge, component(s) is rendering two times instead of one. It functionally works as I wanted, but I will not make this feature in production.
