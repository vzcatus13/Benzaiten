[Live Preview](https://benzaiten-vzcatus13.netlify.app/)

Benzaiten is front-end web application which I wrote to learn more about React.

As the end result I know more about React, Styled Components (and CSS Modules as well SCSS, but here they don't used here), GraphQL (Apollo Client), because project utilize [AniList's API](https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/)
